            <br>
            Our Democracy​ operates an online platform where certain users ('Campaigners') run campaigns to raise
            funds for their social or political projects. They raise funds by asking for contributions from other
            users ('supporters') in return for tangible and intangible rewards. The funders do not get any monetary
            return on their funding amount. Every campaign has a funding goal and a defined deadline to reach this
            funding goal.
